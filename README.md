# Testing the Developer branch and merging it to Master branch using Jenkins
Here we are using Jenkins to test and merge the GitHub repo branches.
We have here two branches one is 'dev' branch and other one is 'master' branch.
So here we will first test the files of our 'dev' branch that whether they are working properly or not.
If they are working properly only then we are going to merge the 'dev' branch data to the 'master' branch.
As the 'master' branch is the main branch of our repository, so we don't want that any file with any problem goes to master branch.
That's why we are firstly required to test the files of our other branches which in our case is 'dev' branch.
Only when the testing gives us positive result about the 'dev' branch files, then we are going to merge our 'dev' and 'master' branches.
